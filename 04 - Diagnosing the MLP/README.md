# 🩺 Diagnosing the layers

This will be crazy. We will literally see the weights of each layer and fix the distributions if they are little "wanky".

## 📔 In this section:

🔧 Train the model a little to get the weights.<br>
📊 **Plot** the weights distributions and see how they look.<br>
💀 Dealing with dead neurons and prevent them to, you know just be dead!<br>
❔ Discuss why does that happen, activations?<br>
🌱 Kiming Initialization!<br>
📏 The ins and outs of **Batch Normalization**, oh my!

>  There are many 🧐 `scrutinizers` along the way, so be prepared!
