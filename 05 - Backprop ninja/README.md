# 🥷🔪 The Confidence Booster

> You will ***feel crazy*** after completing this section. Here we will do all back propogation, *element-by-element*, for *each layer*, *all by hand*. We will **see** 👀 the backpropogation in action, live.

## 📔 In this section:

🔧 Train the model so that we get the initial weights in the forward pass.<br>
⏸ Hit **pause** in the multidimentional place, and there we will do the stuff.<br>
◀ Start backpropogating, from the very last layer to the very first layer, updating weights in between.<br>
✅ Checking **our** weights with the **pytorch's** weights, and make sure we both have the same weights!<br>
🍹**Chill!** everything is visualized!

And of course it will all start with `#loss.backward()` 😉
