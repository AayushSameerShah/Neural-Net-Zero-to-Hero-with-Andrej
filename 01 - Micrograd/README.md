Let's make the first steps towards the NLP by **understanding the atoms of neural networks**!

## ðŸ“” In this section:

âž• We will kickoff the understanding of the atomic pieces of the neural net: *operations*.<br>
â—€ We will see how to **lay out** the expression and backpropogate through them!<br>
â›“ How to perform the chain of derivations and effectively carry out the **chain rule**!<br>
ðŸ“‰ The derivations, slopes, a change? Okay, we'll have the overview anyways!

All math is in ***our*** language, don't worry ðŸ˜‰
