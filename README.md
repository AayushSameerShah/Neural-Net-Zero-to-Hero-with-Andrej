# 🔩 Understanding nuts and bolts of GPT
A short-straight-visualized notebook course to build your own GPT. Yes, from scratch 👣

# 🔤 Some background
Haven't expected 2023 will present the future which we dreamed since decades. I was grown up with the "toys" which could give some *glimpse* of how the AI looks like, which could *generate* real facial images, if you've heard of *thispersondoesnotexist.com* and a couple of others. 

But now, there are a hell, let me repeat **a hell** lot of generative tools out there popping up nearly everyday. As a CS/DL student, it has always been a point to be curious how the hack does this thing work. 

Started with *noobie* questions:
- Can the chatGPT remember things?
- Oh, those are the weights, but how does it manage to create a perfect, gramatically correct sentence!?
- It also takes care of the CaPitaliZation, proper indentation if asked for the code etc...

It had to be explored, and in a great depth. And that's where I found **Andrej Karpathy** 🤘 <br>
And this notebook course, takes you on the journey to the GPT starting from the very first babysteps.

# 😬 Means what? What does it include anyways?
The karpathy's series is fantastic, but I love things to be ***spelled out*** even more, and a cherry on the top, if ***visuallized***. I am willing to refer to some *specific* topic in the future, and if I can't find out that, seeking through the video, then I get frustrated.

**This notebook course** implemets all code and math understanding buildup with **informal explanation** that we understand; the simplest language possible, *you know the bro's language, yo!?* 😆 and also we will keep building one step at a time 🧗

# 🤓 How to read it?
I would encourage you to use this course as a material for **practicing** your understanding and a place to **refer back** to some specifics in the future but use [Andrej's series](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) as a main guide.

🤗 Each notebook is creafully crafted for **to-the-point** reading <br>
➗ Darivations, expressions are *explored*, *experimented* and *visualized* in the dude's words. So, don't sweat off with the maths.<br>
📔 Notebook has a lot of visuals to understand the flow, be it *backpropogation*, *bug hunting* or just visualizing the *neural net*. <br>
👨‍💻 Code is there, code is there... and is reproducible. <br>
📎 Clips to the specific portion of the lecture to refer to.

I mean, there's a lot there... just start exploring!!

# 🗺 Where to start?
Start with the very first lecture `Micrograd`.
1. **Micrograd**: Our first steps to the neural net, here we will explore the expressions at the atomic level and how to *slope* or *derivative* is calculated. Will build a little clssifier too.
2. **Makemore**: The first version of our GPT. But not the GPT exactly because doesn't use the transformer. But this Makemore is the term used to name the model. The model is capable of generating **human names**. We will start with the simple bigram model, no ML/DL done yet, just you know, the first stepping stone.
3. **Makemore with NN**: Here we will prove how the model can learn the relationship of the bigram model *(manual model)* built in the previous lecture.
4. **Improve on NN**: This is the core. Here we will see the **scruitinizers**. How to diognize the model, what went wrong, batchnorm and other exciting stuff when the model isn't learning or... learning wrong.
5. **Backprop Ninja**: This will boost up your backpropogation confidence like a hell. We will backpropogate through each layer, manually, spelled out, visuallized, codized.
6. **WaveNet**: A new architecture to train the model.
7. **GPT**: *(underdev)*

### 🦘 It's not ended; yet.
Andrej's last lecture is on GPT, but there is a lot to explore. So `to be continued...`
