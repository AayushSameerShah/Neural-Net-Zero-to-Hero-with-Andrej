# 🧠 GPT - Crafted By Hands

> This is the definition of the "Capstone". All things from the past, the knowledge from all lectures from the past will be combined here. 



## 📔 In this section:

🏠 We will create the **base** with the GPT-Premiere.<br>
🧰 First will fill our tool box with the essential and technical concepts. Be it attention, masked attention, multi headed masked attention or just a feed forward layer, we will **spend** around 96% of our time there. <br>
🎞 It will feel like a **movie**. All characters will be introduced from the ground up - and yeah you will watch them grow.<br>
🙀 **"Yo!"** will be the guide, starting from the start and ending with it.<br>
🖼 Decoder only model? Shapes? Internal transformations? Shapes? Every detail is visualized.<br>

... and much more fun in-between 🚬

> *Get ready for a rollercoaster of GPT goodness! Buckle up because we're about to embark on a wild journey through the minds of the past with a sprinkle of 'Yo!' and a dash of decoder magic. Let's turn this Capstone into a caperstone! 🎩🚀*
