Alright, if the sentence above looks *too early* then be it, but after this section you will have a rough idea how GPT is ***"autoregressive"*** and how does it *sample* the data for the generation. Of course, it will be little toy, but be sure it will soon become GPT.

## 📔 In this section:

🖊 We will create the basic bigram model which only **looks one token back** to generate the next token.<br>
🧮 We will calculate the internal connections between all character **manually** to create the basics for the upcoming **token embeddings**.<br>
🧞‍♂️ That relations will help us generate new names!<br>

🤨 To get you excited enough, have you ever seen the following names?

- huria
- eigrali
- delle
- jamarda
- chriy
