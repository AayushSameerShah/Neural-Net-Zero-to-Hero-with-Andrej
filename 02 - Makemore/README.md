Alright, if the sentence above looks *too early* then be it, but after this section you will have a rough idea how GPT is ***"autoregressive"*** and how does it *sample* the data for the generation. Of course, it will be little toy, but be sure it will soon become GPT.

## 📔 In this section:

🖊 We will create the basic bigram model which only **looks one token back** to generate the next token.

🧞‍♂️ That relations will help us generate new names!

🤨 To get you excited enough, have you ever seen the following names?

- huria

- eigrali

- delle

- jamarda

- chriy
