# 🌊 WaveNet

Apart from our *regular* MLP architecture, we will see how a new autoregressive architecture *(actually used for audioprocessing and generation)* can be used for our text generation purpose.

## 📔 In this section:

🏛️ Will understand a new architecture of the model and how it differs.<br>
📥 How we will **create** the dataset, because it requires us to provide input in a special way.<br>
🗳 Here, the **shapes** will matter the most, and they will feel like a breeze.<br>
🔢 We will learn how to create the **sequential** container by hand.

## 🎁 By now...

The model would have become much more mature than the past other versions, so we will give it a spin **to generate our *(my name)*** by giving it my name's initials "Aay" and let the model to complete my name! You will be able to check for yours! 🙀
